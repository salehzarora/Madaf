**A B2B supplier catalog & ordering platform for local goods suppliers.**
Sales reps open the catalog on a tablet inside the shop; owners browse,
pick package quantities and send a clean order request — instead of
WhatsApp photo albums.

> **Phase M7C — staging deployment readiness (docs + CI + safe config).**
> Adds a [staging deployment guide](docs/deployment/STAGING_DEPLOYMENT_M7C.md)
> and [runbook](docs/deployment/RUNBOOK_STAGING.md) (Vercel + hosted Supabase
> checklists, env matrix, rollback, monitoring, demo data), a **secret-free CI**
> workflow (lint + build + audit), and a pure server-only misconfig linter. It
> **deploys nothing, commits no secrets, connects no hosted Supabase**, and
> changes no runtime/RLS/schema — legal stays OFF, no payments, dev fake-OTP off
> in staging. Built on:
>
> **Phase M7B (+ M7B.1) — phone-OTP sign-in (primary login method).**
> Supplier/admin sign-in is now **phone-number OTP** (`signInWithOtp`/
> `verifyOtp`), with email+password as a secondary fallback. **No tenant/RLS
> boundary changed** — sessions still bind to an `auth.users` id and
> membership/roles/RLS come from `tenant_users`; **no migration**. Hosted phone
> OTP needs an SMS provider configured in the Supabase dashboard (**no provider
> secret in the repo**). **M7B.1** made local phone OTP actually work
> (`config.toml` enables a **dummy, non-secret** local SMS provider + test-OTP
> map → real local session, no SMS sent) and **server-enforces** the
> email/password fallback (`signInAction`/`signUpAction` reject in phone-primary
> production unless `MADAF_EMAIL_AUTH_ENABLED=true`), plus a fail-closed,
> default-off DEV fake-OTP path for mock mode. No legal/M6 change;
> `legal_effective` stays hard-false. See
> [docs/AUTH_AND_ACCESS_MODEL.md](docs/AUTH_AND_ACCESS_MODEL.md) §2b. Built on:
>
> **Phase M6G — production activation review gate (docs only).** Added
> [docs/legal-invoicing/PRODUCTION_ACTIVATION_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md](docs/legal-invoicing/PRODUCTION_ACTIVATION_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md)
> — **no code, schema, or runtime change**. M6B–M6F remain sandbox / non-legal /
> default-safe; **no real issuing is enabled**. That checklist is required before
> any future legal-effective work: production / legal issuing must not be enabled
> until a qualified Israeli accountant / tax advisor **and** legal counsel review
> and approve against current official sources. Built on:
>
> **Phase M6F — sandbox archival & signing (non-legal, disabled by default).** A
> write-once, **NON-LEGAL** archival + signing layer for M6E sandbox documents —
> tamper-evidence placeholders only. `sandbox_archive_and_sign_legal_document`
> (server-only, **dormant**) is owner/admin-only, fail-closed behind the DB kill
> switch, validates the target is an M6E sandbox non-legal row, generates a
> canonical payload + SHA-256 in SQL (no caller JSON), and is write-once
> (immutability trigger). Signatures are `SANDBOX-…` placeholders; a HARD CHECK
> keeps `legal_effective=false`. **Not a real archive/signature, not
> tax-compliant** — no tax invoice, allocation number, provider, production mode,
> payment, or legal PDF. Built on:
>
> **Phase M6E — sandbox-only legal orchestration (disabled by default).** A
> server-only, **dormant** orchestration (`src/lib/legal-invoicing/orchestration/`)
> that wires tax settings + numbering + sandbox provider into a *simulation*
> behind every gate (three env flags + a service-role-only DB kill switch +
> owner/admin + tenant readiness). Even fully enabled it writes only clearly
> **SANDBOX / NON-LEGAL** rows (`draft_internal`, `sandbox=true`,
> `legal_effective=false`; a HARD CHECK makes a legally-effective row impossible).
> **Nothing real is issued** — no tax invoice, allocation number, provider/tax-
> authority call, payment, PDF, or customer legal download; `SandboxProvider`
> verify hardened to accept only sandbox-shaped values. `legal_effective` stays
> false until a future reviewed phase. (M6E.1 hardened the DB RPC so a direct call
> cannot bypass the app — it enforces tenant tax readiness, draws the M6C number
> itself, and persists no caller JSON.) Built on:
>
> **Phase M6D — sandbox/mock provider adapter.** A server-only legal-invoice
> provider abstraction (`src/lib/legal-invoicing/provider/`) with a
> **NullProvider** (disabled) and a **SandboxProvider** (deterministic mock,
> every response marked non-legal), selected by `MADAF_TAX_PROVIDER_MODE`
> (`disabled`|`sandbox`; **`production` is clamped to `disabled`**). **No real
> tax-authority integration, no allocation number, no credentials, no production
> mode, no payments, no legal PDF** — it changes no document, attaches no
> `legal_number`, sets no `issued` status, and is wired to no UI/route (dormant).
> M6E adds real (sandbox-first, flag-gated) issuing after a professional review.
> Built on:
>
> **Phase M6C — disabled legal numbering skeleton.** A `draw_legal_document_number`
> RPC (owner/admin, atomic) that draws an **internal, non-legal preview**
> (`DRAFT-LEGAL-YYYY-######`), **fail-closed behind two default-OFF gates** (a
> service-role-only DB kill switch + the `MADAF_LEGAL_NUMBERING_ENABLED` env flag
> gating a dormant, unwired helper). **Issues nothing** — no tax invoice, no
> allocation number (מספר הקצאה), no provider, no payment, no legal PDF, no
> `legal_number` on documents — and no UI/route draws numbers. (M6C.1 hardened
> input validation: year must be `2000..2100`, and legal-entity scoping is
> rejected until modeled — invalid calls draw nothing and write no row.) Needs a
> professional tax/accounting/legal review before real issuing (M6D-M6G). Built on:
>
> **Phase M6B — inert legal-invoicing foundation.** Per-tenant **tax settings**
> (owner/admin, at `/admin/settings/tax`), a server-only **feature-flag reader**
> (three flags, all default OFF/`disabled`, fail-closed, never `NEXT_PUBLIC`),
> and an **inert legal schema** (8 RLS-locked tables + enums, **no issuing/
> numbering RPC, no provider call, no route, no bucket**). **Nothing is issued:**
> no legal tax invoice, no allocation number (מספר הקצאה), no tax-authority/
> provider call, no legal number, no payments — and no draft "not a tax invoice"
> warning is removed. Saving tax settings issues nothing (the page says so in
> he/ar/en). Needs a professional tax/accounting/legal review + official-source
> verification before any real issuing (M6C-M6G). Built on:
>
> **Phase M5B — stored PDFs & signed URLs** (hardened in **M5B.1**).
> Generated document PDFs are now stored in a **private** Supabase Storage
> bucket and served via short-lived, access-checked **signed URLs** (no public
> URLs). The admin order-detail page lists per-type document history (status ·
> number · date) with **download** and **regenerate**. Access is verified by
> the server route (RLS `can_access_order` + validated RPCs): owner/admin any
> order, a sales_rep only assigned-customer orders, cross-tenant/anon blocked.
> M5B.1 locks uploads/overwrites to a **trusted server-only path** — normal
> users cannot write to the documents bucket directly. Hebrew/Arabic PDF
> spacing is much improved. **Still drafts only — no legal tax invoices, no
> tax-authority integration, no legal numbering, no payments.** Built on:
>
> **Phase M5A — documents & PDF foundation.** Admins download real
> server-generated PDFs for the three safe document types — **order request,
> delivery note, and invoice DRAFT** — from the order-detail page
> (`/admin/orders/[id]`). PDFs render from order snapshots (Hebrew-first,
> `?lang=` for ar/he/en); invoice drafts always carry a DRAFT watermark +
> "not a tax invoice" notice, and every PDF footer says so. **Still no legal
> tax invoices, no tax-authority integration, no legal numbering** — drafts
> only. Generation is gated exactly like order reads (owner/admin any order,
> a sales_rep only assigned-customer orders) via the `create_order_document`
> RPC; documents stay RPC-only writes. Built on the M4 access-control
> foundation below.
>
> **Phase M4D — access-control enforcement.** The UI is the polished
> trilingual M0 design (no payments, and **no legal tax invoices** — drafts
> only; see [docs/MVP_SCOPE.md](docs/MVP_SCOPE.md)). Building on **M4C**
> multi-tenant switching, **M4D** ENFORCES **sales_rep customer scoping**: a
> sales rep sees only the customers assigned to them and can create orders
> only for an assigned customer (owner/admin see and order for all) —
> enforced at the DB via `can_access_customer` in the customers RLS policy
> and `create_order_request`. It also adds **owner transfer**
> (`promote_tenant_owner` / `demote_tenant_owner`, last-owner-protected) and
> a **stronger anonymous-token rate limiter** (a global per-purpose counter
> that never blocks valid tokens; the raw token is never stored). Owner/admin
> manage rep assignments + ownership on `/admin/team`. Customers still order
> with no login via tokenized `/shop/<token>` links; direct table writes stay
> RPC-only. **Mock stays the zero-config default** — no auth, open demo
> admin. Documents/invoices are M5/M6. See
> [docs/AUTH_AND_ACCESS_MODEL.md](docs/AUTH_AND_ACCESS_MODEL.md).

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # → http://localhost:3000  (redirects to /he)
```

Other commands: `npm run build` (production build), `npm run start`
(serve build), `npm run lint`.

Requirements: Node 20+ (developed on Node 22), npm.
The app runs in **mock mode** by default — no database or env vars needed.

### Optional: Supabase mode with real auth (M4A, local dev only)

```bash
supabase start     # needs Docker + Supabase CLI — see supabase/README.md
supabase db reset  # re-apply migrations + demo seed
docker exec -i supabase_db_Madaf psql -U postgres -d postgres \
  < supabase/bootstrap-auth.sql          # create the demo auth users
cp .env.example .env.local
# in .env.local: set NEXT_PUBLIC_MADAF_DATA_MODE=supabase
# (NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL + NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY come pre-filled)
npm run dev        # sign in at /he/login as owner@madaf.local / madaf-demo-1234
```

Reads are server-side only (RSC) under RLS; **all writes go through Server
Actions → tenant-validated DB functions** gated by `authorize_tenant`
(the client-submitted `tenant_id` is never trusted). Anonymous visitors
see no supplier data (the catalog is not public); customers reach a
tenant-scoped catalog only through a private link token, and place orders
via an anon RPC that prices everything server-side. No Supabase key beyond
the public anon key reaches the browser, and the session lives in httpOnly
cookies. RLS stays deny-by-default (only ever tightened), and the mode
refuses to run in production or against a non-local Supabase URL. Full
model: [docs/AUTH_AND_ACCESS_MODEL.md](docs/AUTH_AND_ACCESS_MODEL.md).

## Manual test checklist

1. `/` redirects to `/he`; `<html>` has correct `lang`/`dir` per locale.
2. Catalog: search "cola"/"קולה"/"كولا", toggle category & manufacturer
   chips, clear filters; empty state appears for nonsense queries.
3. Add products → sticky cart bar appears with package count + subtotal.
4. Pick a shop ("ordering for") → visible on catalog; survives reload.
5. Cart: change quantities, remove items; checkout prefills shop details.
6. Send order request → success screen with order number; cart is empty.
7. Admin dashboard numbers match mock data; recent orders clickable.
8. Order detail: move status along the pipeline (resets on reload — demo).
9. Inventory: low-stock filter; expiry column only for dairy items.
10. Documents: open an invoice draft → DRAFT watermark + legal notice;
    switch document language he/ar/en; print preview hides app chrome.
11. Order detail → Documents card → Download PDF (order / delivery /
    invoice draft): a PDF downloads; the invoice draft shows the DRAFT
    watermark + "not a tax invoice" notice; the delivery note has no prices.
12. Repeat a spot-check of 2–4 in Arabic and English.
